        <p class="lead mb-4">There was a specific match that I played and I was not doing well. The strategy I started with was not working against this guy. This ship was sinking and it was sinking fast. I had to think of something. But I remembered what the grandmaster told me about how to look at a match. From then on I changed my thought process. I started doing moves that I normally would never do playing the game my way. I started making ground and I was hopeful. Unfortunately, I was already too far behind this guy and even though I had made up ground it wasn‚Äôt enough. I was disappointed but also ecstatic that I was learning to cultivate a play style that fit me.  Even my opponent after the match told me how surprised they were at the 180 my strategy had taken and how I did things he didn‚Äôt even think of. It made me realize that we both looked at the same board yet saw two completely different things. After that, I started to ask people after they played me what they saw I could have done. That would then be added to my style. The things that I learned from hearing the view from the other side of the board helped me get a lot better. It helped me think of more creative tactics or plans. I would also play a lot of chess online because Covid had me stuck indoors. I would play a match and then go back and see how I could have moved or what other way could I have played.


Playing chess helped me see things in a light I never would have. It‚Äôs helped me with how I organize my workload. I see all of my work as pieces and how can I take those pieces down. I do my work based on how I can get all of it done well and efficiently. Mountains of work that seem like a lot can be split up and conquered ‚Äúpiece‚Äù by piece. Chess has also shown me that different views can help shape something amazing. When I have things I want to do or think of doing,  I go to others whether that be friends or family. I ask them how I can improve this. That has helped me overcome a lot of problems or lead to new experiences. For instance, I know that I have a one-track mind to things that I don‚Äôt know or understand. I would just do it and call it a day. But for things like family gatherings that actually require looking nice and presentable, I would ask advice from people that know what they are doing like my mother. 

Chess also made me realize that there is never one right answer. It ties in with there being different views, and with different views come different solutions. That is something I still work on to this day, how there is never one right answer, rather there are many as long and you can look at it from a different angle. When I was at home during covid and my teacher wanted us to do something outside of school that we enjoyed or wanted to learn how to do. I only thought of one idea of what to do the project on. I went to my family to see if they could help me. With their help I was able to talk my way through a lot more good ideas for the project. I decided to make a website about setting up classes to teach chess. It took a good 3 months to build the website. I had to create the platform, the external links, and the internal links. Had to make sure that the website looked nice and presentable. I would get my family's input on things like what design looks better or what layout of the website looks better. Getting those different opinions from different views helped me make the website better then it would have just with my one opinion. If I had never learned to play chess in a creative manner I never would have these skills and use them in my everyday life.

        I always wanted a sibling, and when my little sister arrived when I was 6 years old, I was overjoyed. She and I have always been very close. We even have a day called Emma and JJ Day. It is a day when, after we are finished with our day‚Äôs school work, we spend time together in my room and even eat dinner there. 

Two years ago, when I found out Emma was struggling in school I wanted to help her. We had been alerted by the school that she was falling so far behind in class that she needed to work with a resource specialist. Helping Emma became a family affair in which each of us played an essential role.  My job was and remains devoting an hour each day to guiding her through her math homework. When teaching her I have found that she is better with constant repetition. She seems to forget if we only do problem types a few times. We used flashcards everyday to make sure she could get her multiplication tables down, and as of today, she has mastered multiplication. 

I do this because my family is my treasured community. It felt great helping Emma because I love her so much and because it takes the pressure off my mother who then has time to attend to other family needs. My experience has also made me more interested in Psychology. 

Observing the ways in which Emma thinks so differently from me has underscored the uniqueness of each human mind. While anatomically almost identical, each brain, influenced by a multitude of experiences and stimuli, directs an infinite number of behaviors and attitudes distinctly different from those guided by another brain. The fact that two brains put in the same environment are completely different makes me wonder what truly affects the brain function and cognition

        I have always been emotionally mature for my age. I attribute this to my mother‚Äôs guidance when it came to helping me identify how I felt at any given moment. ‚ÄúAre you mad,‚Äù she would ask, accompanying the question with an angry face. ‚ÄúAre you sad?‚Äù That parenting style helped me develop empathy for other people, whose own emotions I was able to discern. Later, as a camp counselor working with children ages nine to twelve, this emotional sensitivity helped me communicate with my campers.  How I expressed myself to one child could easily fall flat with another.  Some children understood oral instructions, while others required demonstration. Seeing the difference in the children‚Äôs responses inspired my interest in the field of psychology.  I wanted to learn how people take in the world, process it, and then react to it. 

After taking Psychology in junior year, I was given the opportunity to work as a research assistant to a doctoral student. Her dissertation was about students of color and the correlation between their GPA‚Äôs and their physical and emotional safety at school. The data required for such research included  percentage of each ethnicity on each campus, suspension rate per ethnicity, and average graduation rate per ethnicity, along with 15 other variables. My role was to collect and organize the data into a spreadsheet, which was to be used as a foundation for the entire paper. The dissertation was published through UCLA, and when the doctoral student defended it, she was kind enough to mention my name in reference to the data collection method. 
 
The research taught me that there are many variables that can influence a person‚Äôs mental state, which can directly affect their productivity. This is especially true of children and teens, who constitute the most impressionable age group. Having compiled the data, I was familiar with each variable independent of the next.  This in and of itself was interesting, but watching the interrelationship between multiple variables reveal an often surprising multi-dimensional picture was thrilling. I hope to immerse myself in this kind of complexity as a Psychology major.





I then went searching for a way to learn more about Psychology which led me to taking Psychology class.  Then in the winter I was given the opportunity to be an Research Assistant at UCLA working under a P.h.D student helping with her research. The dissertation was on the correlation for students of color between school climate and safely and GPA. All of the data that was gathered had to with suspension rate, percentage of each ethnicity on the campuses, and many other pieces of data. This work was to being the awareness of how students of color are impacted by how they are treated at school, which is displayed through their GPA and behavioral infractions.  The dissertation was published at UCLA and when she defended the it she was kind enough to mention my name when going over the data collection method. 
The experience with the research taught me so much about Psychology. The research side of Psychology is so interesting and how the data works together is fascinating. Also the things one can learn from looking at the data working coherently is so amazing.
